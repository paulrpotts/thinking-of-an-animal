# thinking-of-an-animal
This program is a very simple Python implementation of the classic Animal guessing game, as published in 1979 in _BASIC Computer Games: TRS-80 Edition_, edited by David H. Ahl, and in other similar editions. According to this book, Animal was "originally developed by Arthur Luehrmann at Dartmouth College" and "subsequently shortened and modified by Nathan Teichholtz at DEC and Steve North at Creative Computing."

Python has object-oriented features, and I could have implemented this program using classes and objects. But, in keeping with the spirit of early BASIC, I chose not to use these features.
